    <h2>Here are some of the projects I have done with the help of Moringa School</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My first webpage</li>
      <p>It is a simple webpage which I first created when I came to Moringa school. It describes lightly my purpose at Moringa and it includes a link to Moringa School and a link to my second project</p>
      <p>I created it when learning the basics of HTML and CSS. You can check it out here https://github.com/solonka/first-webpage.git</p>
