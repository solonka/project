    <h2>Here are some of the projects I have done with the help of Moringa School</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My first webpage</li>
      <p>It is a simple webpage which I first created when I came to Moringa school. It describes lightly my purpose at Moringa and it includes a link to Moringa School and a link to my second project</p>
      <p>I created it when learning the basics of HTML and CSS. You can check it out <a href= "https://github.com/solonka/first-webpage.git">here</a>.</p>
      <li>Resort</li>
      <p>It is a simple webpage meant to be used by a hotel. It is meant to let people know of the hotel's services wherever they are.</p>
      <p>In it there are several pages linked. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/solonka/resort.git">here</p>
      <li>Trave ageny</li>
